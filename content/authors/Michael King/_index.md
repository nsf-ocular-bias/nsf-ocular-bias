Dr Michael King joined Florida Institute of Technology’s Harris Institute for Assured Information as a Research Scientist in 2015 and holds a joint appointment as Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences and Cyber Security.

Prior to joining academia, Dr King served for more than 10 years as a scientific research/program management professional in the United States Intelligence Community. While in government, Dr King created, directed, and managed research portfolios covering a broad range of topics related to biometrics and identity to include: advanced exploitation algorithm development, advanced sensors and acquisition systems, and computational imaging. He crafted and led the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity’s (IARPA) Biometric Exploitation Science and Technology (BEST) Program to transition technology deliverables successfully to several Government organizations.

Recognized as an expert in biometrics and identity intelligence, he has been invited to brief the Director of National Intelligence, Congressional staffers and science advisers, Defense Science Board, and Intelligence Science Board. He also served as Intelligence Community Department Lead to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management (2005 – 2012).

Dr King received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in 2001 and has research interests in the areas of biometrics, cyber identity, and machine learning.
