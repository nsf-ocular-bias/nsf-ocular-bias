  abstract = 	 {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.}

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

    abstract = "{Purpose: Pathological gambling is an increasing public health concern, but very little is known about this disorder in older adults. This study evaluated gambling and psychosocial problems across age groups in treatment-seeking gamblers. Design and Methods: At intake to gambling treatment programs, 343 pathological gamblers completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and gambling questionnaires. Participants were categorized by age into young adults (ages 18‚Äì35 years; n = 97), middle-aged adults (ages 36‚Äì55 years, n = 197), and older adults (aged older than 55 years, n = 49). Differences in demographics, gambling variables, and ASI composite scores were compared across the groups. Results: The middle- and older age gamblers were more likely to be female (45\\%‚Äì55\\%) than were the younger gamblers (23\\%), but the groups were similar with respect to most other demographic variables. When controlled for gender, older age was associated with increased employment problems, but fewer social, legal, and substance-abuse difficulties. Compared with middle-aged gamblers, older gamblers wagered on fewer days. Age √ó Gender effects emerged in onset of gambling problems and amount spent gambling. Older women did not begin gambling regularly until an average age of 55 years, whereas older male gamblers generally reported a lifelong history of gambling. The older female gamblers also wagered the greatest amounts in the month prior to treat-ment entry. Implications: These data suggest that older adults compose a minority of treatment-seeking gamblers, but differences in psychosocial problems across the age groups may suggest the need for interventions tailored to particular issues encountered by older pathological gamblers. Specifically, treatments focusing on later life development of problems may be indicated for older female gamblers.}",
